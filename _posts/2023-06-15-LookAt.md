\\
In this post I'm going to sketch out some stable methods of computing and storing the parameters of the so-called *look-at* rotation. Everything here is more complicated than standard methods, so for it to be of any interest one or more of the following would need to be desirable:

* Directly generate a quaternion, yaw-pitch-roll or swing-twist decomposition
* Filtering of the result (say temporal smoothing)
* Dealing with regions of instability
* Branch-free *friendly* implementations

\\
This list makes it a a pretty narrow thing to want to do and this is partially intended to show some ways to attack moving an ill conditioned problem to a backward stable one without using any *fancy* floating-point tricks and attempting to avoid a mess of random branching to work around. Backward stable can be roughly defined as "the solution is exact for a nearby input" but here since we have a multi-component input (a unit vector) and multi-component output(s) so it's more: "in the very small neighboorhood of the output is an exact solution for a nearby input".

\\
First let's define the convention that will be used:

* A right-handed coordinate system with
  * $\mathbf{x}$ is to the *right*
  * $\mathbf{y}$ is *forward* and
  * $\mathbf{z}$ is *up*.

\\
There are various standard constructions. We might start with a pair of positions for the "entity" in question.  Call $\left(p_0\right)$ the entity's position and $\left(p_1\right)$ a target position for it to face toward. Then the facing unit vector $\left(\mathbf{v}\right)$ is:

$$ \mathbf{v} = \| p_1-p_0 \| $$ 


where $\\| \cdot \\|$ denotes normaling the contained expression. Or the unit or arbitrary magnitude vector might be directly provided.  Most variants will also provide another unit vector parameter $\left(\mathbf{w}\right)$ which specifies the direction the entity considers to be *up*.

Given the convention and inputs we can compute the local *right* unit vector $\left(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{x}'\right)$ by:


$$ \mathbf{r} = \| \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w} \| $$ 


from which we can compute the local *up* unit vector $\left(\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{z}'\right)$:

$$ \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} $$

Reduced standard method
------

\\
Let's look at a standard construction with a reduced problem statement. First we'll limit the input forward vector $\left(\mathbf{v}\right)$ to unit magnitude:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \left( x,~y,~z \right)
$$

\\
Since we can just normalize prior to calling our routine this is minor. The next limitation is bit bigger. We're going to fix the parent up to $+\mathbf{z}$. This drastically simplifies the math and the end goal here is to produce a rotation (or decomposed rotation).  Expanding with these limitations gives:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{r} & = \mathbf{x}' & = \| \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{z} \| & = \left\{\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},~\frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},~0\right\} \\
\mathbf{u} & = \mathbf{z}' & = \mathbf{x}' \times \mathbf{y}' & = \left\{\frac{-x z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},
                      ~\frac{-y z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},
                      ~\frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right\}

\end{align}
$$

Let's note the key properties:

1. we're producing an orthonormal basis so:
  * $\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$
  * $\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 1$
2. the $z$ component of $\mathbf{r}$ is zero so it's bound to the $\mathbf{xy}$-plane and can be expressed as $\mathbf{x}$ rotated about $\mathbf{z}$


\\
The above expressions are written to reflect how the computation is going to be performed. Now a tempting change would be to replace $x^2+y^2$ with $1-z^2$ since $\mathbf{v}$ is unit but


<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
**Danger, Will Robinson!**

we know that our input is only approximately unit and (even if carefully computed) each component will (generally) have small errors.  Let's simplify and assume that:


$$ \mathbf{v} \cdot  \mathbf{v} = 1 $$ 

exactly and that $y=0$ and $z=1$ then:

$$ \mathbf{v} \cdot  \mathbf{v} = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + 1 = 1 $$ 

This implies that $x^2$ is too small to contribute to an addition with one so:

$$ x^2 \le u $$

where $u$ is the size of the rounding unit $ \left( \frac{1}{2}\text{ulp}(1) \right) $ which is $2^{-24}$ in single precision so:

$$ |x| \le 2^{-12} \approx 0.000244 $$

which is a *very* different result that zero. Notice that this isn't a single precision problem and we're in the same boat in any precision. As an example since doubles have a wider dynamic range (can represent a wider range of exponents) the issue is more pronounced. Below is a floating point number line on $\left[0,~1\right\]$ where the "units" are ULP (so each "step" is the next floating point number we can represent). The top (blue) range shows the range of values that $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ might be when $\|z\|$ is approaching one and the bottom (purple) for doubles.

![unstable]({{site.base}}/assets/figures/misc/qlook_line.svg 'unstable'){: .center-image }


All of this might seems cursed if it's unfamiliar but it allows us to represent *unit* vectors very nearly pointing in cardinal directions and performing the "correct" computation is only very important if the result is highly sensitive to the sub-result. Aside: a previous [blog post](https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/quaternions/2017/08/08/QuatRotMatrix.html) on quaternion/matrix conversion shows that making these kinds of transforms can drastically increase *relative* error even in well conditioned regions.

\\
Ahem. Anyway. Another issue is when $x$ and $y$ are both zero we have an infinite number of solution (and we're ill conditioned on the approach) so we need to add *decision making* for that case.  Let's assume that we start in the default orientation (forward = $\mathbf{y}$ and up = $\mathbf{z}$) and are rotating toward the input giving us a $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ rotation about $\mathbf{x}$ where the sign that of the input $z$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{r} & = \left\{1,\hphantom{-}0,~0\right\} \\
\mathbf{u} & = \left\{0,-z,~0\right\}
\end{align*}
$$

\\
For the approach let's consider a biased version of the above expressions (with $n = x^2+y^2 $):

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{r} & = \left\{\frac{y+b}{\sqrt{n+b}},~\frac{-x}{\sqrt{n+b}},~0\right\} \\
\mathbf{u} & = \left\{\frac{-x z}{\sqrt{n+b}},
                      ~\frac{-\left(y+b\right) z}{\sqrt{n+b}},
                      ~\frac{n}{\sqrt{n+b}}\right\}

\end{align*}
$$

\\
If $b$ is zero then they reduce to the previous set and if $b=1$:

* $\left(n+b\right) = 1$ if $ n \le u $
* $\left(y+b\right) = 1$ if $ y \le u $

\\
so if we conditionally set $b$ to zero or one based on some threshold value of $n$ we create deadzones in the tiny spherical caps around $+\mathbf{z}$ and $-\mathbf{z}$.  The threshold should be no smaller than the square root of the smallest normal number to avoid hard to compute cases and no larger than $\sqrt{u}$ so than the magnitude of $z$ should be one and both biased terms flush to one.

Finally some noteworthy implementation details. We don't need to carefully compute $n$ as it won't help much alone and we'll be pretty tight keeping everything simple. The example code below does use `fma` but this is just for performance reasons (under the assumption that floating point contractions might be disable). Also we don't want to perform five divisions (or even [corrected multiply by reciprocal](https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2019/03/12/FpDiv.html)) so I'll use the scale factor `s = sqrt(1/(n+b)` which has the [lowest average error](https://gist.github.com/Marc-B-Reynolds/9fb24a7a4ee915e6e973bf9f4d08c404) of the simple choices.

Euler angles <small>Yaw-Pitch (but no Roll)</small>
------

\\
We can parameterize a unit vector using a [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system) where the radius is fixed to one and using a *mathematical* style convention of $\theta$ being the angle from $\mathbf{y}$ in the ${\mathbf{xy}}$ plane and $\phi$ the angle from ${\mathbf{xy}}$. 

$$ 
\begin{align*}
\theta & = \text{asin}\left(z\right) = \text{atan}\left(z,~\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\right) \\
\phi   & = \text{atan}\left(-x,~y\right)
\end{align*}
$$

\\
where the arctangent is the two parameter form (`atan2`). We want to compute $\theta$ using `atan2` to avoid NaNs if $\|z\|$ has creeped above one during computations and to get a more accurate measurement (same reasoning as above for computing $n$ as $x^2+y^2$).

\\
If we treat these angles as the *yaw* $\left(\phi\right)$ and *pitch* as $\left(\theta\right)$ of the [Euler angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes) (really should be called [Tait-Bryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#Tait%E2%80%93Bryan_angles)) parameterization commonly used in aviation then the resulting rotation produces our desired local right and up vectors.

\\
So the pitch is a rotation about $\mathbf{x}$ which as a matrix is:

$$
P = \left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & \cos (\theta ) & -\sin (\theta ) \\
 0 & \sin (\theta ) &  \cos (\theta ) \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

\\
the yaw is a rotation about $\mathbf{z}$:

$$
Y = \left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
 \cos (\phi ) & -\sin (\phi ) & 0 \\
 \sin (\phi ) &  \cos (\phi ) & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

\\
composing the two rotations gives:

$$
YP = \left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
 \cos (\phi ) & -\cos (\theta ) \sin (\phi )  &  \sin (\theta ) \sin (\phi )  \\
 \sin (\phi ) &  \cos (\theta ) \cos (\phi )  & -\sin (\theta ) \cos (\phi )  \\
 0            & \sin (\theta )                &  \cos (\theta ) \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$

\\
and yanking out the columns give the local basis:

$$
\begin{array}{rrr}
\mathbf{r}   =  \mathbf{x}'  = & \left(\hphantom{-\sin\left( \theta \right)} \cos\left(\phi\right),~\hphantom{-\cos\left( \theta \right)}\sin\left(\phi\right),                               ~\hphantom{\cos\left(\right)}0  \right) \\
\mathbf{f}   =  \mathbf{y}'  = & \left(  -\cos\left( \theta \right) \sin \left( \phi \right),~\hphantom{-}\cos\left( \theta \right) \cos \left( \phi \right),~  \sin\left( \theta \right)  \right) \\
\mathbf{u}   =  \mathbf{z}'  = & \left(\hphantom{-}\sin\left(\theta\right)\sin\left(\phi\right),~-\sin\left(\theta\right)\cos\left(\phi\right),~      \cos\left(\theta\right) \right)
\end{array}
$$


\\
slapping this into toy code gives:

{% highlight c %}
typedef struct { float yaw, pitch; } lookat_yp_t;

lookat_yp_t lookat_yp(vec3_t v)
{
  lookat_yp_t r;

  r.pitch = atan2f( v.z, sqrtf(fmaf(v.x,v.x,v.y*v.y)));
  r.yaw   = atan2f(0.f-v.x,   v.y+0.f);

  return r;
}

basis_t yp_to_basis(lookat_yp_t yp)
{
  float cp = cosf(yp.pitch), sp = sinf(yp.pitch);
  float cy = cosf(yp.yaw),   sy = sinf(yp.yaw);

  // 'f' reconstruction can be skipped if we have original 'v' and we
  // keep the restriction that 'v' must be (approximately) unit.
  vec3_t r = (vec3_t){.x=    cy, .y=    sy,  .z=0.f };
  vec3_t f = (vec3_t){.x=-sy*cp, .y= cy*cp,  .z=sp  };
  vec3_t u = (vec3_t){.x= sy*sp, .y=-cy*sp,  .z=cp  };
  
  return (basis_t){.r=r, .f=f, .u=u };
}
{% endhighlight %}


\\
I haven't bothered with introducing the small cap region since `atan2` will manange to yield reasonable results. But notice the funky inclusion of zeroes in both inputs of the *yaw* `atan2`. This is to normalize the result to zero when both $x$ and $y$ are zeroes where otherwise it can any of the following four depending on how the signs shake out: $\pm 0$ or $\pm \pi$.  Note that this isn't branch-free *friendly* because of the arctangent and the unit vector input requirement isn't really needed here and if that requirement is dropped then the computation of `f` in `yp_to_basis` is cheaper than performing it elsewhere. We've already performed the bulk of the work.

Oh! And as an example of how easy it is to get $\|z\| = 1$ and $\|n\| \ne 0$ let's peek at reconstructing $r$ with $\phi=\pi$:

    phi = RN(pi)                             // 0x1.921fb6p1
    r   = {RN(cos(phi)), RN(sin(phi)), 0}    // {-1, -0x1.777a5cp-24, 0} 

\\
where `RN` is the default floating-point rounding (round to nearest, ties to even).

Two complex decomposition <small>not sorry for the bad pun</small>
------

\\
We can take the previous and carry through the inverse trig followed by forward trig operations:


$$ 
\begin{align*}
 \cos(\theta) & = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} = \frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \\
 \sin(\theta) & = z \\
 \\
 \cos(\phi)   & = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \\
 \sin(\phi)   & = \frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}
\end{align*}
$$ 

\\
Of course we have all the terms we needed in the vector construction and get identical expressions if we perform the
reconstruction.  Vector expressions (without bias) repeated for convenience:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{r} & = \left\{\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},~\frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},~0\right\} \\
\mathbf{u} & = \left\{\frac{-x z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},
                      ~\frac{-y z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},
                      ~\frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right\}

\end{align*}
$$


\\
Other than showing the equivalence of the *Yaw-Pitch* and vector constructions it seems interesting to show the "same thing" in a different way in case anybody has an "ah ha!" moment.  Plus it's a natural stepping stone to the next section.  The section name comes from we can think of this as a pair of independent unit complex numbers. One for the $\mathbf{xy}$ plane for *yaw* and the other in the $\mathbf{yz}$ plane for *pitch*.


But anyway coded up explictly this way gives:


{% highlight c %}
typedef struct {
  float cp,sp;      // cos(pitch), sin(pitch)
  float cy,sy;      // cos(yaw),   sin(yaw)
} lookat_tc_t;


lookat_tc_t lookat_tc(vec3_t v)
{
  lookat_tc_t r;

  // SEE: lookat_std
  static const float cap = 0x1.0p-63f;

  float n = fmaf(v.x,v.x, v.y*v.y);
  float b = n > cap ? 0.f : 1.f;
  float s = sqrtf(1.f/(n+b));
  float y = v.y + b;
  
  r.cp =  n   * s;
  r.sp =  v.z;
  r.cy =    y * s;
  r.sy = -v.x * s;

  return r;
}

basis_t tc_to_basis(lookat_tc_t tc)
{
  // 'f' reconstruction can be skipped if we have original 'v'
  vec3_t r = (vec3_t){.x=       tc.cy, .y=       tc.sy,  .z=0.f   };
  vec3_t f = (vec3_t){.x=-tc.sy*tc.cp, .y= tc.cy*tc.cp,  .z=tc.sp };
  vec3_t u = (vec3_t){.x= tc.sy*tc.sp, .y=-tc.cy*tc.sp,  .z=tc.cp };
  
  return (basis_t){.r=r, .f=f, .u=u };

Swing-twist decomposition
------

\\
The short version of a [swing-twist decomposition](https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/quaternions/2022/01/31/QuatAxisFactor.html) decomposition (click through for more) is that we factor a rotation into a pair of quaternions. The first is a rotation about a fixed axis (here $\mathbf{z}$) and this component is termed the *twist* $\left(T\right)$. The second rotation, the *swing* $\left(S\right)$, is in the orthogonal complement (so some rotation axis in the $\mathbf{xy}$ plane). Here we only have two degrees of freedom and the twist is limited to about $\mathbf{x}$. So the Euler and swing-twist decompositions directly map to one other in our problem. In general *swing* contains both yaw and roll information.  Directly plugging yaw-pitch info gives:

$$
\begin{align*}
    S^2 & = \cos\left(\theta\right) + \left(\sin\left(\theta\right),~0,~0\right) \\
T^2 & = \cos\left(\phi\right) + \left(0,~0,~\sin\left(\phi\right)\right) 
\end{align*}
$$

\\
Recall that in quaternions we need half the angle of the desired rotation so the terms are squared. So what we want is this:

$$
\begin{align*}
S & = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \left(\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),~0,~0\right) \\
T & = \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) + \left(0,~0,~\sin\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\right) 
\end{align*}
$$


Replacing with the direct terms from the previous section:

$$
\begin{align*}
S^2 & = \frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} + \left(z,~0,~0 \right) \\
T^2 & = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}   + \left(0,~0,~\frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

\\
with some substitutions:

$$
\begin{align*}
n   & = x^2+y^2  \\
c & = \sqrt{n} \\
\\
S^2 & = \frac{n}{c} + \left(z,~0,~0 \right) = c + \left(z,~0,~0 \right)  \\
T^2 & = \frac{y}{c} + \left(0,~0,~\frac{-x}{c}\right) \\
\end{align*}
$$

\\
and we need to apply the [half-angle indentities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Half-angle_formulae).  Starting with swing:

$$
\begin{align}

S & = \sqrt{\frac{1+c}{2}} + \left(\text{sgn}\left(z\right)\sqrt{\frac{1-c}{2}},~0,~0\right)  \label{s0} \\
  & = \frac{1+c}{\sqrt{2\left(1+c\right)}} + \left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{2\left(1+c\right)}},~0,~0\right) \label{s1}
\end{align}
$$
  
\\
Equation $\eqref{s0}$ is cheaper at two square roots where $\eqref{s1}$ is one and a divide. Here we'll use the former. Neither have stability problems and in the limit approach:
  
$$
\begin{align*}
S & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \left(\frac{\text{sgn}\left(z\right)}{\sqrt{2}},~0,~0\right)
\end{align*}
$$


\\
The twist expands as:

$$
\begin{align}
T & = \frac{c+y}{\sqrt{2c\left(c+y\right)}} + \left(0,~0,~\frac{-x}{\sqrt{2c\left(c+y\right)}}\right)  \label{t0} \\
  & = \frac{c+y}{\sqrt{2\left(n+cy\right)}} + \left(0,~0,~\frac{-x}{\sqrt{2\left(n+cy\right)}}\right)  \label{t1}

\end{align}
$$

\\
where $\eqref{t1}$ is the generally more interesting form since we can use an FMA to compute $\left(n+cy\right)$ for both a performance and accuracy win. Note we now have two ill conditioned regions instead of one. Like before when both $x$ and $y$ are approaching zero and additionally when $y$ is approaching $-1$. The $\left|y\right|=1$ cases are:


$$
\require{mathtools}
\begin{align*}
T = \begin{cases}
1 + \left(0,~0,~0\right) & y = \hphantom{-}1 \\[2ex]
0 + \left(0,~0,~1\right) & y = -1
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$


\\
as a foreshadowing of how I'll attack negative $y$ which is by argument reduction. The *twist* is a function of a point $p=\left(x,y\right)$ in the unit disc and we can map that point into the first quadrant $p' = \left(\left|x\right|,~\left|y\right|\right)$, transform $p'$ and reverse the reduction.  A visualization of the quadrants:

![disc]({{site.base}}/assets/figures/misc/qlook_d1.svg 'quadrants'){: .center-image }

<br>
and after halving the angle with respect to $\mathbf{y}$:

![quad]({{site.base}}/assets/figures/misc/qlook_d2.svg 'quad'){: .center-image }

\\
If the input $x$ was negative then we reflected about $\mathbf{y}$ and if $y$ was negative then reflected about $\mathbf{x}$. To restore a negative $y$ input we need to reflect about the diagonal (angle has been halved):

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{cos}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha\right) & = \text{sin}\left(\alpha\right) \\
\text{sin}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha\right) & = \text{cos}\left(\alpha\right)
\end{align*}
$$

\\
So the first step can be to compute pair values $t_w$ and $t_b$ and swap if $y$ is negative:

$$
\begin{align}
\left(t_w,~t_b\right) = \begin{dcases} 
\left(c+\left|y\right|,~\left|x\right|\right) & y \ge 0 \\[2ex]
\left(\left|x\right|, ~c+\left|y\right|\right) & y \lt 0
\end{dcases} \label{ts}
\end{align}
$$

\\
If the input $x$ was negative we simply need to reintroduce the sign and since needed $-x$ in $\eqref{t1}$ we get (this is an assignment and using an arrow looked ugly to me):


$$
\begin{align}
t_b = -\text{sgn}(x)~t_b = \text{sgn}(-x)~t_b \label{ts2}
\end{align}
$$

\\
After performing the steps $\eqref{ts}$ and $\eqref{ts2}$ the twist becomes:

$$
\begin{align}
T = 
\frac{t_w}{\sqrt{2\left(n+c\left|y\right|\right)}} + \left(0,~0,~\frac{t_b}{\sqrt{2\left(n+c\left|y\right|\right)}}\right)  \label{ts3}
\end{align}
$$

\\
Finally we need to tweak the bias application. To get a one in the denominator we need to bias $n$ by $\frac{1}{2}$ when in the deadzone and the $y$ in $t_w$ by one.

We can get the *direct-to-quaternion* formulation from the swing-twist by performing the composition:

$$
\begin{align*}
Q = ST
\end{align*}
$$


\\
Taking $\eqref{s1}$ and $\eqref{ts3}$, replacing the denominators by $a$ and $b$ respectively and performing the product gives:

$$
Q = \frac{(c+1)t_w}{a b} + \left(\frac{z~t_w}{a b},~\frac{z~t_b}{a b},~\frac{(c+1)t_b}{a b}\right)
$$


\\
and expanding $ab$:

$$
\begin{align*}
ab & = \sqrt{2(1+c)}\sqrt{2\left(n + c \left|y\right|\right)} \\
   & = 2 \sqrt{(1+c)\left(n + c \left|y\right|\right)}        \\
\end{align*}
$$

\\
The term inside the root could be expanded but I'll just leave as is and compute it and the other two $\left(1+c\right)t$ terms as $t+ct$ using *FMA*.
